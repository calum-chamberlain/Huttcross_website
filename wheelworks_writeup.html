								<h3></h3>
                  <p>H&uuml;ttcross is into its third season now and it's more
										popular than ever. This year we are lucky enough to have
										two title sponsors in Crucial Custom Cycles and Wheelworks
										Handcrafted Wheels. This is one of a pair of thank-you
										posts. First, we wish to thank Wheelworks for their support
										and give our fans a little information about their business
										and what their support means to us. Tom Lynskey, 1/6 of the
										H&uuml;ttcross committee, visited Wheelworks HQ to get an idea
										of what it was all about.</p>

  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/wheelworks/P5182407.JPG" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

									<p>From the outset, H&uuml;ttcross sought to provide a fun
										and friendly event at little cost to the entrants. We
										were adamant that a quality series need not cost $30-$50
										per event. After two and a half seasons of quality racing
										and emphatic turnouts, we feel we've made our point.</p>

									<div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/wheelworks/huttcross-WW-368.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

									<p>This year, Wheelworks approached us prior to the season
										to offer up a major spot prize: a set of custom wheels.
										Wheelworks was well known to us, as its riders are
										passionate racers and their presence has slowly been
										building from the Lyall Bay workshop. It's difficult
										to tell you exactly what their spot prize will look
										like, because it hasn't been built yet. But that's the
										whole point. </p>

									<p>Wheelworks builds wheels, and that's all they do. Yet,
										 if you rolled out to their workshop to buy some wheels
										 for your sled, you wouldn't find a single wheel that
										 you could purchase then and there. We can't tell you
										 what the spot prize wheels will look like, because
										 Wheelworks doesn't know who has won them yet.</p>

									<div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/wheelworks/huttcross-WW-101.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

									<p>When they build a set of wheels for a client, it begins
										with a conversation. The aims, dreams, quirks,
										proclivities, hopes and desires of the rider are all
										rolled into an amorphous many-limbed equation creature
										in the head of the Wheelworks Brains Trust. It slinks
										about, drawing on years of race-wrenching, product testing,
										tech geeking and observational experience until it
										breathes its own air. That unique beast is then realised -
										given form through rolling, cutting and drawing within
										the many custom tools at the lads' disposal.</p>

									<div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/wheelworks/huttcross-WW-338.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

									<p>The result is one-size-fits-one. The parts that go into
										 the build are selected on the basis of quality, not
										 distributorship loyalties. Everything is measured and cut
										 exactly to suit - to such close detail that all the
										 threads of the nipple are taken up, but not beyond.
										 The whole build is then fed into an enormous hydraulic
										 press that beds the components into place beneath a
										 significant loading force. The benefit of this is that
										 the wheels don't need to be ridden in, because they're
										 already "in" when they leave the workshop. This is vital
										 when they are sending their product out of the country.</p>

									<div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/wheelworks/huttcross-WW-117.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

									<p>The precision and customisation is impressive, but there is
										 no doubt it comes at a premium price. "I'm not concerned
										 if we lose a customer to the local bike shop down the
										 road", Jesse explains, "unless it's because I've failed
										 to convey what exactly we provide."</p>

									<div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/wheelworks/huttcross-WW-058.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

									<p>As someone who has built wheels myself, and ridden many
										great wheels from storied Wellington builders, I could
										see the case for what Wheelworks do. Aside from being
										a helpful resource for those riders who know what they
										want their wheels to do, but not how to spec to suit,
										Wheelworks' service should also appeal to anyone who
										prioritises an exacting attention to detail, and values
										peace of mind highly. There is something deeply and
										mechanically satisfying about the tolerances and
										processes that govern a Wheelworks build.</p>

									<div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/wheelworks/huttcross-WW-260.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

									<p>As far as H&uuml;ttcross is concerned, the support from
										 Wheelworks is an affirmation for us, and a boon for the
										 2016 racers. Having passionate riders who actually front
										 up to our races willing to get behind us tells us that
										 we're on the right track. And we're very proud that we
										 can bring a relaxed and professional event with the chance
										 to win an outstanding spot prize that will likely serve
										 the winner well for decades, all for a humble tenner.</p>

									<p>Most of our riders will have a road or mountain bike,
										and upgrading wheels is a simple way of transforming
										the performance of the bike. So if you think you could
										benefit from a new set of wheels, we do encourage you to
										start your search with Wheelworks. If their service is
										not what you need, they'll be the first to let you know.</p>

									<p>Failing that, you could always just make sure you win the
										spot prize draw on the 7th of August.</p>
