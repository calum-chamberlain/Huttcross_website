								<h3>Round 2: Moonshine</h3>
                  <p>Moonshine Park, what a venue. The Dean's course was party all over.
                  Flat double-backs where competitors scrutinised one another with deranged
                  eyes - juggling deficits and observing technique. Greasy corners that unhitched
                  riders and spat them sideways. As one handsome bystander remarked during the A
                  Grade race: "you know shit is rowdy when a flat 30-degree corner sends dozens
                  of people flying into the tape."</p>

                  <div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/r2_2016/HCR2TL-4.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

                <p>At some point during the day the immense downpours in Kaitoke Regional
                  Park forced some anonymous controller to open a floodgate - and the ditch we
                  had routed the course through became a creek. That event alone was enough
                  to claim a few good scalps.</p>

                  <div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/r2_2016/HCR2TL-1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

                <p>Riders across the grades pitched themselves against the elements. There
                  were compelling reasons to stay at home, but fortunately there were more
                  compelling reasons to attend.</p>

                  <div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/r2_2016/HCR2TL-3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

                <p>But, for as much fun as everyone seemed to have, the final race was
                  doubtless the feature. Many times, even a greasy course has been rendered
                  rideable by the time A Grade gets to it - the sun bakes the sludge into
                  tacky playdough and riders can up the speed. But not this time. This time
                  the showers that had drifted through the preceding grades grouped
                  together and set in as rain.</p>

                  <div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/r2_2016/HCR2TL-5.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>

                <p>Spectators scrambled to fit beneath the pop tents and gazebos that are
                  currently stretched out drying in a garage somewhere. One observer
                  remarked that the racers plugging away - plagued by cold, hard sheets of
                  rain - was one of the loneliest things she had ever seen. The desolation
                  expanded across the reserve, hearts hardened, teeth gritted, fingers numb,
                  and many found the minutes delivered to them in slow, painful drips.
                  At the head of the race, a brutal swapping of the lead played out.
                  The lead riders dug into one another and forced themselves clear,
                  attack after attack unhitching competitors until just two remained.</p>

                  <div class="box alt">
  									<div class="row uniform 50%">
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  										<div class="8u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/r2_2016/HCR2TL-7.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                      <div class="2u"><span></span></div>
  									</div>
  								</div>


                <p>It was deeply impressive to see the riders claw a little more from
                  themselves and plunge it into the mud, just to gain a metre, maybe two,
                  and have it fall through their fingers in the space of a corner. In the
                  end, Kyle Ward snatched it in the sprint. That day, everyone gained
                  something. Rather than turning their blankets closer, the riders had
                  entered the world. And the gaunt, splattered faces at the finish line
                  betrayed the raw truths they had all found.</p>
