								<h3></h3>
								  <p>Anders Waiker is a big, gentle, generous, kind and
										reticent Swedish man. He also builds custom bike frames.</p>

									<p>He was our first sponsor, before we even really had a
										series. I believe the conversation happened in an
										inauspicious carpark in Wainuiomata. You're picking up
										the cyclocross series? he asked. Yeah, reckon someone has
										to, I replied. Cool, well do you want me to throw in a
										custom frame as a spot prize?</p>

												<div class="2u"><span></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
									<p>Just like that. That sort of casual and thoughtful spirit
										typifies him.There was no song and dance or transaction
										about it, just a very affirming "what you're doing is
										cool, let me help" sort of thing.</p>

												<div class="2u"><span></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
									<p>We've had a few conversations throughout the seasons -
										he's given us two frames already and this year will mark
										the beginning of a third - and I've always been anxious to
										ensure he is getting a good return on his investment.
										You know, that we're spreading the good word or whatever.
										Every time I've just been met with a shrug, and it is
										clear that he's in it for the love.</p>

												<div class="2u"><span></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
									<p>Building bike frames isn't Anders' daily bread, he just
										does it because he loves the process. </p>

									<p>"If I charged a fair hourly rate nobody would buy a frame",
										 he once remarked to me.</p>

										 	</div>
										 </div>
									<p>In terms of what Anders is about, does the case really
										need to be made for a custom frame? His website is pretty
										informative in that regard. By engaging an expert to build
										something for you, it is charged with only relevant things.
										It represents you anatomically, but also philosophically -
										it is optimised for what you want to get from it, what you
										want to visit on it, and what it is about riding that gets
										you buzzed.</p>

												<div class="2u"><span></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
									<p>The previous winners' bikes represent this. They've both
										gone to very deserving winners. Richard's disc cross is a
										stunning build. In that way that we have of justifying
										things he said, well I've saved a shitload on the frame,
										so I can splash out on everything else. And Kirk's drop
										bar monster thrash adventure slayer is exactly the kind
										of thing you'd expect to see between the legs of a big,
										strong, adventureful man. It was wonderfully executed.
										We've thrown in some pics of Anders' current build - a
										lovely Reynolds 853 Randonneur Bike.</p>

												<div class="2u"><span></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
									<p>But aside from the fact that he is a major spot prize
										provider, the real reason we want to plug Anders is because
										of who he is as a person. The generosity, reticence and
										kindness that he exudes is bound to result in an exceedingly
										pleasant build experience.</p>

									<p>For a sport that captivates us and breathes fresh air
										into our lives on a daily basis, we are remarkably stingy
										and short-sighted about our gear. Sure, that Taiwanese
										frame that is knocked together for your aggregate size
										is cheaper and will do the trick, but the real value we
										see in Anders' product is the ability to engage in the
										process. It's almost as if the finished product is the
										denouement - the physical resolution of the process that
										came before it. The true story.</p>

									<p>Anders, and by extension Crucial Custom Cycles, is a rare
										pocket of Wellington where you can still engage in old
										school, soulful construction. While it might cost more
										than riding the LCD wave, we're talking apples and
										oranges. We're only around a short time, and there is a
										compelling argument to be made about taking a little
										extra time, and maybe burning a little extra cash, to
										make sure it's done once, and in a very permanent and
										specific way.</p>

												<div class="2u"><span></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
									<p>The support we have from Crucial Custom Cycles is
										extremely gratifying. To have Anders stand behind us
										attests to the soulful nature of what we're doing.
										Hopefully this little contribution can bring some
										attention to his craft. If you're minded to look at
										getting a new frame, we encourage you to give Anders a
										call and start the conversation. It could turn into once
										of the most pleasant you've had for some time.</p>
