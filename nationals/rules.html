          <div class="inner">
            <p>These rules apply to the National Champs races being held by
              Huttcross on 6 August 2016. They don't apply to the Huttcross
              regular season races being held the following day - which are
              covered by the normal Huttcross race rules. </p>

            <p>You'll be asked to agree to these rules when you enter one
              of these races. </p>

            <h3>Bikes </h3>

            <p>Cyclocross bikes only. That means drop handlebars and tyres
              no wider than 35mm. Bikes must be safe to use (including at
              least one functional brake). Perhaps consider consulting your
              local bike shop on this front. </p>

            <h3>Stuff you wear </h3>

            <p>Helmets are compulsory. Clothing must at least cover the
              nether regions. Shoes should be covered (no touring
              sandals). Race numbers must be pinned to your back. <p>

            <h3>Elite and age grade races </h3>

            <p>It's up to you whether you enter the elite (60 minute) or
              age grade (50 minute) races. The elite races are open to
              all ages. Licenses are not required for any race. </p>

            <h3>Practice </h3>

            <p>There are designated practice times in the morning and
              before the elite races. Between races, stay off the race
              course while people are still on the course racing. </p>

            <h3>The start </h3>

            <p>The race organisers have discretion to put known kick-ass
              racers on the front row. Otherwise it's all self seeded.</p>

            <h3>Race etiquette </h3>

            <p>Ride hard, embrace the competition, but be a decent person.
              No unreasonable aggression, physical violence, or mean-spirited
              abuse. The organisers have full discretion to pull you
              from the race if you misbehave. </p>

            <h3>Age grade races </h3>

            <p>These will be a combined start and finish (rather than wave
              starts and separate finishes for different grades).
              Results for each grade will be determined within the
              combined results. </p>

            <h3>Getting lapped </h3>

            <p>We will not be pulling riders from the race if lapped by the
              race leader. </p>

            <h3>Bell lap </h3>

            <p>A bell lap will run between the race leader starting their
              final lap and the race winner finishing. This means you
              may not get a bell lap if you are lapped by the leader
              in that time. </p>

            <h3>Finish </h3>

            <p>Return your timing chip and move away from the finish line once
              you have completed your race. We don't want pile ups of
              sprinting riders on the line. If you don't return your
               timing chip, you'll be charged $55 to replace it. </p>
