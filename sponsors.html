								Anders Waiker is the man behind Crucial Custom Cycles and his frames are a thing of beauty, built with precision and passion and tailored to fit you and your riding style.

								<p>
								Velo Creations NZ Bicycle Painting are joining forces with Crucial Custom Cycles to bring some full deep custom love to that steel frame. 
								Former NZ Cyclocross Champion, Brendon Sharratt, is sponsoring a single colour custom paint job (with logos throughstencil) to give back to the H&uuml;ttcross scene he has enjoyed being part of for many years. 
								If you want to add additional colours you can top up this rad prize with a few dollars to get exactly the finish you’re looking for.

								<p>
								Wheelworks have been ahead of the game for a long time believing in the use of discs and wider rims well before the industry cottoned on. Back to sponsor H&uuml;ttcross for a second year, they love our local cyclocross race scene and enjoy pushing the boundaries on their own rides exploring some of the more remote gravel reaches of Wellington. Their tried and tested Maker is the perfect wheelset for mid-week commutes, weekend mud and I'm-not-sure-where-this-road-goes adventures.
								</p><p>
								Every race you enter puts you into the draw to win a special Wheelworks wheelset worth $1,300 and you can choose whether you want to customise it for road, MTB or (of course) CX.

								<p>
								Niner NZ are our newest addition to the H&uuml;ttcross party. Niner are big fans of fun in the dirt and the Road Less Travelled. They named their Swiss Army knife of off-road drop bar bikes the RLT - a wicked steed that you can use to commute to work on Monday, race H&uuml;ttcross on it that weekend then take it wandering your local backroads the following one.
								</p><p>
								If you’ve ever wondered just how much fun it is to navigate a drop bar skinny tyres bike between the tape at H&uuml;ttcross but only have a MTB at home then now is your chance to book a race on an RLT! Thanks to Niner NZ have one demo 53cm RLT available to be raced at each of the remaining rounds of H&uuml;ttcross. The demo RLT will suit riders 5’6 to 5’9 in height. All you need to do is <a href="mailto: huttcross@gmail.com">tell us</a> why you want to race the Niner RLT so bad and we’ll select one lucky winner for each round of H&uuml;ttcross!
