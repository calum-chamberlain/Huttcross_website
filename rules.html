							<h2>The Rules</h2>
							<p>H&uuml;ttcross rules</p>
						</header>
						<section class="wrapper style5">
							<div class="inner">
								<h3>Who do these rules apply to?</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>These rules apply to all Huttcross Club members -
										if you're a member of the Club, you've agreed to be bound
										by bylaws of the Club (such as these rules).</li>
									<li>People who aren't Huttcross Club members will be asked
										to agree to comply with these rules when entering a
										Huttcross event.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>When do these rules apply?</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>These rules apply in relation to all Huttcross race
										events - before, during and after races. There may also
										be other rules that apply in relation to individual
										events.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>So, what are the rules?</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Be a decent human being. Everyone is at a Huttcross
										race to have a good time, so don't do things that
										interfere with other people's enjoyment of the race.
										That means you should only perform rad passing
										manoeuvres, jumps, skids, etc. when you know it won't
										pose a risk to people near you.</li>
									<li>Ride within your ability. Falling off can hurt. Make
										sure you're comfortable riding the course, including
										by checking out the course before your race start.</li>
									<li>Stay in the tape, go over the obstacles as designed.
										No one likes a course-cutter.</li>
									<li>You're responsible for having a bike that works and is
										safe. Check bolts are tight, wheels are attached, and your
										bike is free of spinning knives, lasers, and explosive
										ordnance. And you must have at least one working brake.</li>
									<li>Use appropriate cycling kit. That means a non-broken
										helmet, shoes, and at least some clothing. Have even
										more clothing if it's cold (which it probably will be).</li>
									<li>Help anyone who is injured. This ain't no World Cup.</li>
									<li>Keep off the course when other races are on. There
										will be time for you to try out the course between
										races - don't mess with others peoples' races and the
										timers by going on the course when it's not your turn.</li>
									<li>No burglars. Don't race down a grade only to claim a
										hollow, crushing victory over someone who has been
										working hard all season with the aim of taking
										their first win in a brutal battle to the line.</li>
									<li>Be careful when around the event area. That
										includes avoid scratching cars, running over other
										people's bicycles, or starting brawls. You're also
										responsible for ensuring any children in your care are
										similarly careful.</li>
									<li>We own your image. Well, not exactly. But we may
										use photos of you in promotional or other published
										material. And we make no guarantees that they'll be
										flattering photos.</li>
									<li>The organisers may boot you out. If we think you're
										causing problems, we have full discretion to remove you
										from the race without a refund.</li>
								</ol>
